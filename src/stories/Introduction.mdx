## Development Tools

### Storybook
Our Storybook setup includes:
- Component documentation
- Interactive examples
- Design system guidelines
- API documentation
- Accessibility checks
- Responsive design testing

### Testing
We use multiple testing approaches:
- Unit tests with Vitest
- Integration tests with React Testing Library
- End-to-end tests with Cypress
- Visual regression tests with Chromatic

### Code Quality
We maintain high code quality through:
- TypeScript for type safety
- ESLint for code linting
- Prettier for code formatting
- Husky for pre-commit hooks
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Design System

Our design system is built on these principles:

### Colors
We use a semantic color system:
- Primary: Actions and key elements
- Secondary: Supporting elements
- Neutral: Text and backgrounds
- Feedback: Success, warning, error states

### Typography
- Font: Inter for modern, clean aesthetics
- Scale: Modular scale for consistent sizing
- Weights: Regular (400), Medium (500), Bold (700)

### Spacing
We use a 4px grid system:
- 4px = 0.25rem
- 8px = 0.5rem
- 16px = 1rem
- etc.

### Components
Our components follow these guidelines:
- Accessible by default
- Responsive design
- Consistent API patterns
- Comprehensive documentation
- Performance optimized
